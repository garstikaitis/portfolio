      <h1>Concept</h1>
      <p>
        We all, at some point in our lives wanted to cryptocurrency trading. But usually we are not feeling safe investing in something that we don't know.
        This is where
        <a
          href="https://cryptosandbox.eu"
        >CryptoSandbox</a> comes in.
        Users will start out with 10.000$ fictional capital and compete against other players in trading currencies which price is being calculated in real-time.
      </p>
